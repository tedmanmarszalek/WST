{"_id":{"$oid":"57070972029e8dfe32ef99af"},"sculpture_name":"Early Morning Walk","artist_statement":"I woke up at six o'clock one morning in 2008 and said to myself, \"I should immortalize someone today\". (Being a sculptor I do this from time to time.)  That day being a Thursday I needed to get the garbage out.  So as I was approaching the curb with the garbage I saw a young rabbit in his pajamas walking his dog.  Normally I don't pay much attention to those things but this was a short, sort of pudgy rabbit, and his pajamas did not fit him very well. He also had on pink slippers, which stood out quite prominently.  Later in the day, as I was preparing to immortalize someone, I remembered this young rabbit and his dog.  The idea occurred to me that if I made this rabbit taller and somewhat thinner he might be more attractive.  But I decided keep his slippers the same as I remembered.  The dog needed a full overhaul, however.  He was quite unkempt.  I gave him a dog \"sweater\" as the weather was getting cooler and decided to make it the same color as the rabbit's pajamas.  It was at this point in the whole process that I had what I thought was a brilliant Idea. \"If I emphasize the blue polka dots in both the rabbit's pajamas and the dog's sweater and actually physically cut them into the steel, I can get the weight down on my sculptures significantly.\" (I often struggle with the weight of my artwork).  I do not know how successful this idea was, but like a lot of things, once I had done it, I was stuck with it.  I do know that when I showed the piece at Art Basel in October of the following year, not one person commented on the polka dots.  In fact no one commented on my work at all.  I remind myself though that an artist's work is seldom appreciated in his or her lifetime.  It took quite a while to finish this sculpture, as I was trying to get the rabbit's face to look both pensive and quizzical.  Many of my works attempt to show this. I think it is the stuff that life is made of. Yes it’s a little thing, but little things are important.  Because I took so long on the \"pensive and quizzical look\" I missed the application deadline for a major show at the Whitney in New York. However, I did get to show the piece in Stamford Connecticut. I feel ok about that as Connecticut actually borders New York and some New Yorkers probably got to see it.  Seeing as how it was early in the morning when all this started, I decided to title my work, \"Early Morning Walk\". It was 2009 when I finally got it finished.","artist":"Ed Haddaway","coordinates_longitude":-88.20007,"coordinates_latitude":40.08295,"audio":null,"image":"/uploads/ea415d8760c1df1d4a40ea72cade66d01460078961763.jpeg","video":null,"active":true,"type":"Sculpture","location":"Wandell Garden","number":0}

The pieces shown here, made of concrete, steel and wood, seek to provide opportunity for two levels of engagement: they are imposing in weight and volume, but the means of their material construction are kept at the surface, allowing the viewer to further engage with naturally-occurring textural details.  With these materials and intentions, sculpture-making has become more about the work process itself than its ends. For me, the image of the lone artist in their studio just doesn't apply. The scale of my work demands collaboration with computer animators, architects, and engineers for purposes of technical design and structural integrity, as well as the contributions of fellow artists and friends in physical construction of each individual project.
